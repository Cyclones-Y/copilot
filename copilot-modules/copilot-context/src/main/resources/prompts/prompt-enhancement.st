3. Structure the request with clear objectives and expected deliverables
4. Include relevant constraints (performance, security, compatibility)
5. Specify desired output format (code, explanation, step-by-step guide)
6. Add context about the project or use case when helpful
7. Maintain the original intent while improving technical clarity
8. For coding requests, specify language, framework, and any dependencies
9. For debugging, include error details and environment information
10. For architecture questions, specify scale and requirements
